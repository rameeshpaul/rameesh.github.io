	  <form>
	    <input type="radio" name="hobby" id="movies" onclick="myHobby(id)"> Movies<br>
		<p id="mo" style="display:none" class="a"> Don't get me started on this. I am a great admirer of art and cinema and movies are definitely one of the most accessible art form out there in today's time.It has replaced other art forms like books,theatre,plays etc. I have very strong beliefs about movies and I feel all mediocre movies should be outrightly rejected by the audience. I feel that people must develop taste in good cinema and must watch cinema all around the world as well within our country. For me it is not just a medium for entertainment but much more than that. There is so much beauty cinema has to offer and if you don't beleive me then you have to watch the legendary and my absolute favourite Satyajit Ray's collection and you would realize how the world of cinema is such an enriching and rewarding engagement. My contemporary favourites are - Krzystof Kielowski, Cristopher Nolan, Anand Gandhi, Dibakar Banerjee, Roman Polanski, Alfred Hitchcock, Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach, Gurvinder Singh, Greta Grewig, Chaitanya Tanmahe, Nagraj Manjule, Vikramaditya Motwane, Rima Das, Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bharadwaj, Nandita Das and the list goes on and on...</p>
	    <input type="radio" name="hobby" id="sports" onclick="myHobby(id)"> Sports<br>
		<p id="sp" style="display:none" class="a"> Don't get me started on this. I have somehow never believed in the core motto of sports, the sense of competitiveness it entails albeit having played so many of them and enjoyed a lot too. I am a National level Hockey player, I have trained myself in Boxing and played Table Tennis, Squash, Snooker, Volleyball, Basketball and Football very passionately at some point in my life. These days, I don't play anything but I follow a lot of sports - Hockey, Badminton, Shooting, Squash, Gymnastics, Field and Track Events, Archery, Kabaddi, Wrestling, Boxing, Table Tennis,Cricket to name a few. I somehow never able to follow football as I feel it takes a lot of time and energy which can be used to follow five other sports. Surprisingly the sense of competitiveness is something I enjoy when watching sports.</p>
	    <input type="radio" name="hobby" id="cooking" onclick="myHobby(id)"> Cooking<br>
		<p id="co" style="display:none" class="a"> Don't get me started on this. I have cooked my breakfast for around 3 years and I totally loved the process. I believe cooking is not just a procedure but also deft craftsmanship. Cooking also has lot of scope for imagination and perusal. I mostly used to cook recipes like Uttapams, Poha, Upma, Idlis, Appams, Vermicelli, White sauce Penne Pasta, Daliya and Tempered oats with my own interpertation for each of these. I feel cooking is such a nourishing and refereshing experience if done and developed properly.</p>
	    <input type="radio" name="hobby" id="music" onclick="myHobby(id)"> Music<br>
		<p id ="mu" style="display:none" class="a"> Don't get me started on this. Music is something that has power to emote and connect to the soul and make us dig deep inside ourselves and all that happens unconsciously as we tune in ourselves to our favourite melody. Everyone I know does enjoy some sort of music and unlike movies I would never judge anyone for the music that he listens to. I feel it is something very close to a person and part of his space. Now enough about my views on Music, my all music playlist would be as - songs from Beatles, songs from Coldplay (the initial years + Ghost Stories), Sona Mohapatra, music of Anupam Roy, A.R Rahman, Amit Trivedi, Sneha Khanwalkar, Neeraj Sridhar(Bombay Vikings), Neha Bhasin, Agnee, Parikrama, Indian Ocean, Shilpa Rao, Coke Studio, The Strokes and so many more I can't think of right away. I am always on lookout for a tune or a piece of soundtrack whether watching a movie, sitting in a restaurant, something playing in some event and I love collecting and discovering music this way.</p>
	    <input type="radio" name="hobby" id="psychology" onclick="myHobby(id)"> Psychology<br>
		<p id ="py" style="display:none" class="a"> Don't get me started on this.Psychology is such a brilliant way to study oneself and understand oneself. It is scientific in nature and gives us a deep dive into how we function - how our sensory organs process stimulus, how our brain processes it, how our memories get formed, how learning happens, how our emotions are developed, if I was to give you just an example to make my case just google skill vs challenge chart which explains how we feel about doing some particular task like your job etc depending upon varying skill we have and challenge the task offers. Psychology is really a study of these kinds of things and it is really a must have tool in your toolkit.</p>
	    <input type="radio" name="hobby" id="philosophy" onclick="myHobby(id)"> Philosophy<br>
		<p id ="ph" style="display:none" class="a"> Don't get me started on this.Philosophy is not a skill or hobby or an interest, it is a way of living. The key motto of philosophy is to encourage in depth discussions on intricate things and not to get a solution to it but develop on them and in process expand our thinking. Philosophy is something that is scientific as well as a learned experience from events, perspectives etc. But it is absolute necessary and it forms foundation for my life concepts.</p>
